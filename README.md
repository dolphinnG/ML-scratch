#Scratch implementation machine learning algorithms

Repo for my implementation of some linear algebra concepts, classical machine learning algorithms, and deep learning algorithms.
I prefer following chalkboard math and analytical solutions, but will resort to numerical solutions whenever the analytical counterparts fail, or whenever it is convenient. 

#todo
- classical ml: kernel SVM, decision tree, random forest, knn, k-mean, linear regression, logistic regression.
- deep learning: tbd...
- write Latex notebook to explain the math and to do graphical visualization
